## Getting Started
When starting to evaluate Infineons OPTIGA™ Connect IoT solution as a proposal you might want to follow these steps:<br>
1. Download the [DataSheet](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-Datasheet_OPTIGA_Connect_IoT-DataSheet-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=5546d462749a7c2d01749b3873b90f57)
2. Order the OPTIGA™ Connect IoT SAMPLE KIT
3. In case you don't have a dedicated `Device` yet, get our OPTIGA™ Connect IoT Evaluation Board
4. Buy a miniPCIe modem of your choice and a LTE antenna. Ensure that the modem is capable to handle eUICCs!
5. If you don't want to solder the VQFN8 package or work with Smart Card readers consider getting our Card Adapter VQFN8 version
6. In case you need adapter that fit in SIM sockets in combination with the Card Adapter VQFN8 we offer a SIM Cable Adapter Kit
7. Download the [Quickstarter Guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-Quick_Start_Guide_OPTIGA_Connect_IoT-AdditionalProductInformation-v01_00-EN.pdf?)

### OPTIGA™ Connect IoT SAMPLE KIT
The kit comes with 7 pcs of OPTIGA™ Connect IoT with predefined dataplan working out of the box for instant trials.<br>

* 5 pcs VQFN-8/MFF2
* 2 pcs ID1 Cards (multi form factor, 2FF, 3FF, 4FF)
* 10 MB of connectivity per eSIM (*)
* 6 month validity from first network connect on
* 150 countries worldwide coverage (Americas, APAC and EMEA)

(*) For all 7 eSIMs included in the Kit a total of 70 MB is available, resulting in an average of 10 MB per item.<br> 
    The weighting between the 7 eSIMs is up to you.
