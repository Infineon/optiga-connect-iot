#### How to read out EID

1)  SELECT ECASD: A0 00 00 05 59 10 10 FF FF FF FF 89 00 00 02 00
->  00 A4 04 00 10 A0 00 00 05 59 10 10 FF FF FF FF 89 00 00 02 00 
<- 90 00

2) GET DATA Tag 5A, EID example= 89034011560010000000000000000121
-> 80 CA 00 5A 12
<- 5A 10 89 03 40 11 56 00 10 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 21 90 00
